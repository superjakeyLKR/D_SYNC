    <p>Wow, you didn't forget to keep using <button id="antimatter_text" onclick="antimatter(11)" style="font-size: 1em;">.</button>htm.</p>
    <p>Anyways, you are nearing the final challenge of level 1.</p>
    <p>To get there, however, you have to pass the L Guardian.</p>
    <p>Despite having 'L' in his name, he actually hates the letter L.</p>
    <p>To find him, you will have to go to "theLDomain".</p>
    <p>You have to remove all unnecessary 'L's from the URL.</p>
    <p>He will only allow the 'l' in https://superjakey<span id="ex">l</span>kr.</p>
    <p>And, obviously, the 'L' in "the<span id="ex">L</span>Domain".</p>
    <div id="toast" style="opacity: 0;">
        <p>You have found a button for ANTIMATTER.</p>
        <p>You have <span id="amount">LOADING..</span>.</p>
    </div>
